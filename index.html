            <p class="scheme">Mohammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. was born January 17th, 1942 in the city of Louisville, Kentucky.<br>
               By age 12 Mohammad Ali started training to become an amatuer boxer to eventually win a gold medal for the light<br>
               heavy-weight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics at age 18. Obviously his accomplishments never ended there,<br> 
               as he eventually became one of the greatest heavy-weight fighters of the world.
            </p>
            /*Applied class scheme */
            <p class="scheme">Growing up during racial segregation and the fact he was of Muslim faith and had such belief's caused problems for<br>
               him. He was found guilty of draft evasion for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War for religious beliefs. Ali indeed<br>
               was an influencial icon of the African American community as a result of his athletic accomplishments, racial pride<br>
               during the civil rights movement, and involvement and enlightenment of others about Sunni Islam.

            /*Applied class scheme */
            <p class="scheme">
                Muhammad had a total of 61 fights in his athletic career and out of all of them won 56 (36 knockouts) lost 5 times.<br>
                Of all these included notorious oponents such as George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Sonny Liston, Leon Spinks, Cleveland<br>
                Williams, Ernie Terrel and many more. The confidence and charisma he showcased in addition to his principals, beliefs<br>
                and the black excellence he showed the world resulted in him being an influental figure in the upliftment of the<br>
                African American community.

                Officially, his fame and recognition has been seen by the likes of powerful organizations. Such organizations include<br>
                Golden Gloves, National Amatuer Athletic Union Champion, The Olympics, Dr. Martin Luther King Memorial Award, Honorary<br>
                Doctorate of Humane Letters (Texas Southern Univesity), Messanger of Peace(United Nations) and many other accolades.

                Fighting was not something this man only did in the ring. Muhammad most definatley fought for racial equality and exerted<br>
                pressure to protest pending issues. Expressing his apprehensions towards fighting in the Vietnam War, he spoke at colleges<br>
                across the United States. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11 he defended the Nation of Islam by expressing that in a nutshell<br>
                that the actions of one or a few people do not define an entire nation as a whole and that Islam is not to be feared. He also<br>
                donated to charity oragizations, non-profits for hunger, disadvantaged people. Muhammed donated and spoke to historical black<br>
                colleges about the importance of education and other philanthropist work.

                Certainly Muhammad will surely never be forgotten. He died June 3, 2016 in Scottsdale, Arizona. The legacy he leaves behind<br>
                spans multiple layers whether it be in academic literature, the numerous statues and monuments in his image, media such as his<br>
                fight footage, his many speakings and protests, the non-profit organizations he invested in, art, and references in popular<br>
                culture. He is survived by his 9 children, of these include Laila Ali his daughter, and grandson Nico Ali Walsh who are also<br>
                professional fighters.
