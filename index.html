            <p class="scheme, blocktext">Mohammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. was born January 17th, 1942 in the city of Louisville, Kentucky.
               By age 12 Mohammad Ali started training to become an amatuer boxer to eventually win a gold medal for the light
               heavy-weight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics at age 18. Obviously his accomplishments never ended there, 
               as he eventually became one of the greatest heavy-weight fighters of the world.<br>

            <p class="scheme, blocktext">Growing up during racial segregation and the fact he was of Muslim faith and had such belief's caused problems for
               him. He was found guilty of draft evasion for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War for religious beliefs. Ali indeed
               was an influencial icon of the African American community as a result of his athletic accomplishments, racial pride
               during the civil rights movement, and involvement and enlightenment of others about Sunni Islam.<br>

                Williams, Ernie Terrel and many more. The confidence and charisma he showcased in addition to his principals, beliefs
                and the black excellence he showed the world resulted in him being an influental figure in the upliftment of the

                Fighting was not something this man only did in the ring. Muhammad most definatley fought for racial equality and exerted
                pressure to protest pending issues. Expressing his apprehensions towards fighting in the Vietnam War, he spoke at colleges
                across the United States. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11 he defended the Nation of Islam by expressing that in a nutshell
                that the actions of one or a few people do not define an entire nation as a whole and that Islam is not to be feared. He also
                donated to charity oragizations, non-profits for hunger, disadvantaged people. Muhammed donated and spoke to historical black
                colleges about the importance of education and other philanthropist work.<br>

                Certainly Muhammad will surely never be forgotten. He died June 3, 2016 in Scottsdale, Arizona. The legacy he leaves behind
                spans multiple layers whether it be in academic literature, the numerous statues and monuments in his image, media such as his
                fight footage, his many speakings and protests, the non-profit organizations he invested in, art, and references in popular
                culture. He is survived by his 9 children, of these include Laila Ali his daughter, and grandson Nico Ali Walsh who are also
                professional fighters.<br>
